This is a simple 2 player Tic Tac Toe game!

to play, run ticTacToe.py on your command line
then enter the coordinates (x, y) of your move, then
pass the computer off to the other player and they can their move. 

coordinates are taken as a string of two numbers, 1-3
for example, moving to the middle of the board would be:
>22
moving to the top right would be:
>13
etc.

Have fun!
